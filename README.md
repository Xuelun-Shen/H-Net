## Environment

This code is based on Python3 and tensorflow  with CUDA 9.0.



## Pretrained models

1. Download the Pretrained [model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oO91kqGwZGBE64ypzyFPoTAggbQTstnz). 
2. Extract them to the current folder so that they fall under `model` for example.



## Cross Domain Dataset

There are 160 pair full size [images](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZwBkYRB9C0-rWvFtKpglM9UwQQBoXxgM) for training. You can process it as you wish.

Download [test data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u1Z00nwd0DbFWmbJrtWaLItd0QkV8gPg)  and extract it. (Remember to change the `data_base_path` in file `trainHNet.py`)
